<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">  Recently, I found in my RSS reader George Butiri’s article named <a href="http://okmaya.com/2014/03/12/the-reason-angular-js-will-fail/">The reason Angular JS will fail</a>. Go ahead and <a href="http://okmaya.com/2014/03/12/the-reason-angular-js-will-fail/">read it</a>  – it’s quite interesting. Naturally, I do not agree with George’s conclusions, but that is not the reason why I wrote this blogpost. <a name='more'></a>  <br />  <br /> What really struck me was the quality of provided code samples. I do not want anyone to read the article and think: <i>„So this is supposed to be the Angular way of doing things? No wonder this shit is doomed.“</i>  <br />  <br /> The provided code shows that George is really proficient with vanilla Javascript and jQuery but lacks (no offense) deeper understanding of AngularJS and its principles.   <br />  <br /> Thats why I decided to go on and fix the code to be more Angularish. Lets skip the first example – it’s easy enough – and start directly with more advanced stuff.   <br />  <br />  <h3>DOM Manipulation</h3>  George tries to do an simple example of two boxes which should move when clicked. This is indeed quite simple task. Let’s have a look at the code from the article (<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/simpulton/E7xER/">original JSFiddle</a>):   <br />  <br />  <script src="https://gist.github.com/krtek/9930bdcc1e175d0d4dc6.js?file=animate-original.js"></script>   <br /> Notice something awkward? Yes, you’re right. This is not AngularJS, this is just bunch of jQuery code wrapped in <i>directive</i> for no obvious reason.   <br />  <br /> As I read the article I thought: „There has to be better way to achieve such simple result.“ Of course there is one and quite straightforward:   <br />  <br />  <script src="https://gist.github.com/krtek/9930bdcc1e175d0d4dc6.js?file=animate.js"></script>    <br /> See? Why not unleash AngularJS <i>directives</i> to their full potential and use them exactly how they are supposed to be used in the first place? There is no need for element searching and attaching&nbsp;<i>click</i> handlers via jQuery.   <br />  <br /> Notice that jQuery is still being used on line 17 for animation itself. Yes. Because AngularJS is not a low-level manipulation library – jQuery truly rocks at this field.   <br />  <br /> What is the main difference then? <b>Readability.</b> Let’s compare source HTML:   <br />  <br />  <script src="https://gist.github.com/krtek/9930bdcc1e175d0d4dc6.js?file=animate-original.html"></script>   <script src="https://gist.github.com/krtek/9930bdcc1e175d0d4dc6.js?file=animate.html"></script>    <br /> In AngularJS case, HTML speaks for itself. You can understand its purpose without even looking at the Javascript code.   <br/> See complete <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/3rom9aoz/36/">JSFiddle</a>.   <br />  <br />  <h3>Ajax</h3>  What about George’s second task? Let’s quote him:   <br />  <blockquote>    <i>For the purpose of simplicity, here’s the requirements:</i>    <br />    <ul><i><li>Two links, and two output elements on the page.</li><li>One link loads a random number in the first element.</li><li>The second link loads today’s date in the second element.</li></i>    </ul>    <i></i>  </blockquote>  This simple requirement is followed by two paragraphs explaining why it’s impossible to achieve this in AngularJS. Ok, pal, here you go:   <br />  <br />  <script src="https://gist.github.com/krtek/9930bdcc1e175d0d4dc6.js?file=server.js"></script>   <br />  (<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/5xm4yqvL/25/">Complete JSFiddle</a> – I couldn’t find online service that would return random number, so I replaced it with IP address. Hope that is not a problem.)   <br />  <br /> But I see the point here. The original article shows how to build a generic system to replace various elements (identified by IDs) with values sent from server. I hope that this example is not taken from real world application. Maintaining such application   must be a real pain in the ass.   <br/> Although I think it is not really an AngularJS way, it’s still perfectly achievable. For example like this:   <br />  <br />  <script src="https://gist.github.com/krtek/9930bdcc1e175d0d4dc6.js?file=server-directive.js"></script>   <script src="https://gist.github.com/krtek/9930bdcc1e175d0d4dc6.js?file=server-directive.html"></script>   <br />  <br /> See? This is where directives really rock. One really just have to resist to urge to sprinkle #IDs all over the HTML code and create unreadable spaghetti.   <br />  <br />  <h3>That's it</h3>  At least for today. AngujarJS might not be perfect, but it's really helpfull in creating readable, maintainable and extendable Javascript applications. </div>
